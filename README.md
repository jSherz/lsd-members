The Leeds Uni Skydiving club organises a number of people learning to skydive
each year and this involves collecting some information, arranging transport
and ensuring they've got all the information they need for a great static line
course weekend. This project was initially created as a public, static, website
for the club but has evolved into a system that will eventually help them book
courses and mange their members.
