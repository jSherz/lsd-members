# Leeds University Skydivers - Management system

The Leeds Uni Skydiving club organises a number of people learning to skydive
each year and this involves collecting some information, arranging transport
and ensuring they've got all the information they need for a great static line
course weekend. This project was initially created as a public, static, website
for the club but has evolved into a system that will eventually help them book
courses and mange their members.

The backend portion of the site is no longer hosted, it's now just the static
frontend.

The website: https://www.leedsskydivers.com

## Frontend

An [Angular](https://angular.io) project and is managed with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli).

## Backend

An [Akka HTTP](http://akka.io/) project, managed with [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/).
